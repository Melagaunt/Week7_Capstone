			<h2>Definitions</h2>
			<P>A game, much like Golf, however we use discs and baskets to score. The execution and goal is much the same as
				well, were you start at a tee-off area, and throw your disc down the course to the next basket.
			</p>
			<p>A disc, is similar in shape and size to a frisbee, but can vary greatly in weight and design. A basket, is
				typically a pole with an elevated basin & chains.
			</P>

			<h2>Rules of the Game</h2>
			<P>Much like golf, our goal is to complete the course in as few strokes as possible. A typically game is 9, or 18
				holes.
			</P>
			<div class="row ">

				<div class="col-5 offset-0.5">
					<p>Tee off order is settled by lowest score on the prior hole. On hole 1, this can be a rock-paper-scisors, or
						a coin flip.</p>
					<p>Players take turns throwing their discs in the general direction of the basket. Begining with the disc
						farthest from the basket.</p>
					<p>Discs are launched from the lie of the previous throw. Follow through steps are allowed on all throws,
						outside of a 10ft putting range.</p>
					<p>Lowest number of throws wins the hole, and earns the right to tee-off first</p>
					<p>Pack it in, pack it out.<br>Try to leave your course better than you found it.</p>
				</div>
				<div class="col-5 offset-1">
					<p>Hazards are to be avoided, whenever possible. These can lead to extra stokes on your score, or even lost or
						damaged discs.</p>
					<p><strong>Trees:</strong> If a disc is in a tree out of reach, place a marker below it while you attempt to
						retrieve. This will be your subsequent launch area</p>
					<p><strong>Water:</strong> Rivers and lakes add to a beautiful experience. A disc lost in water however, will
						sink, and potentially float away. Best to avoid.</p>
					<p><strong>Mandatory:</strong>This is a required flight path. These are generally indicated at the tee, and
						serve the purpose to add difficulty or protect the natural landscape.</p>
